/*****************************************************************************
    This is an example for the xCHIP DEMO KIT

    This examples read data from a SW01 and SL01 as primary sensors
    In Balloon Mission Activities its reads data from SN01 and SI01 Additionally

    Currently Supported on the following â˜’CHIPs:
    - CW01

    The sensors communicates over the I2C Bus.
